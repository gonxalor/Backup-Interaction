# 🧠 Rescue Robot Voice Interaction

This project simulates a voice-interactive rescue robot that uses Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to assess a victim's condition in an emergency situation. The robot asks questions, listens to spoken responses, and provides appropriate guidance based on the answers.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Offline Text-to-Speech with `pyttsx3`
- 🎤 Real-time Speech Recognition via microphone using `SpeechRecognition` + `PyAudio`
- 🤖 Simple decision tree to handle victim responses
- 🔁 Repeats questions if no valid response is captured
